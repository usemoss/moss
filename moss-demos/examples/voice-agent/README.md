# Voice Agent

A customer-support **voice agent** grounded in a Moss knowledge base, with a brand-styled
web UI that shows Moss doing the retrieval live. You talk to it, it searches your data,
and a side panel surfaces the exact chunks Moss returned (with match scores and query
latency) for every turn.

```
Browser (web/)  ⟷  LiveKit room  ⟷  agent.py (STT → LLM → TTS)  ⟷  Moss (RAG)
```

## What you need

- A [Moss](https://moss.dev) account (project ID + key)
- [LiveKit](https://livekit.io) running locally (`livekit-server --dev`)
- [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com) (LLM + text-to-speech) and
  [Deepgram](https://deepgram.com) (speech-to-text) API keys
- Python 3.14+ (`uv`) and Node 18+ (`npm`) for the web UI

## Setup

```bash
uv sync
cp .env.example .env          # fill in your Moss + provider keys
python agent.py download-files
```

`.env` keys: `MOSS_PROJECT_ID`, `MOSS_PROJECT_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`.
For local LiveKit, leave the `LIVEKIT_*` values as-is; for LiveKit Cloud, set them to your
project's URL/key/secret and copy the same three into `web/.env.local`. The index name
defaults to `demo-customer_faqs` (override with `MOSS_INDEX_NAME`).

## 1. Seed the knowledge base

Loads the sample support FAQs in `data/faqs.json` into a Moss index:

```bash
python seed_index.py
```

## 2. Run it

Open three terminals:

```bash
# a) LiveKit server (local dev — uses devkey/secret)
livekit-server --dev

# b) the agent (joins rooms automatically)
python agent.py dev

# c) the web UI
cd web
npm install
cp .env.local.example .env.local
npm run dev            # → http://localhost:3000
```

Open http://localhost:3000, click **Start the demo**, and talk. The right-hand panel
shows what Moss retrieves on each turn.

> Prefer no UI? `python agent.py console` still works for a mic-only, terminal session.

## How the retrieval panel works

On each user turn, `agent.py` queries Moss and publishes the results to the LiveKit room
on the `moss.retrieval` data channel (`{query, docs:[{text, score}], took_ms}`). The web
UI listens on that channel and renders them. The voice pipeline is otherwise untouched.

See [`DEMO_SCRIPT.md`](./DEMO_SCRIPT.md) for a ready-to-record walkthrough.
