# Moss Semantic Search (Obsidian) — Privacy Notes

This describes what the plugin does with your notes and credentials. It mirrors [`apps/moss-vscode/PRIVACY.md`](../moss-vscode/PRIVACY.md) and applies to the code in this folder.

## Summary

- **Your notes are chunked and embedded locally** on your machine by `@moss-dev/moss-core`. Search runs in memory.
- **Cloud sync is off by default.** Nothing about your notes is uploaded unless you enable **Sync index to Moss Cloud** or run **Moss: Sync index to Moss Cloud**.
- **Credentials are stored in the plugin's `data.json`** inside your vault's `.obsidian` folder.
- The Moss SDK may emit **usage telemetry** unless disabled (see below).

## Data stored on your device

| Data | Location | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| Moss Project ID / key | `.obsidian/plugins/moss-search/data.json` | Open a `SessionIndex` |
| Search index (embeddings + chunk text) | `.obsidian/plugins/moss-search/cache/` | Fast local search, instant restore on reopen |
| Index metadata (`meta.json`) | same folder | Which notes are indexed and how many sections each has |

If you sync or commit your `.obsidian` folder, exclude `plugins/moss-search/data.json` (your key) and `plugins/moss-search/cache/` (your note text).

## Data sent to Moss Cloud

1. **Authentication** — the project ID and key are sent to Moss to validate the session when the plugin starts.
2. **Cloud sync (opt-in)** — when enabled, the note text of every indexed section, its metadata (path, headings, line numbers) and the locally computed embeddings are uploaded via `pushIndex()` to the index `obsidian-<hash>` in your Moss project — after the initial build **and again, in full, shortly after any note edit** (the upload replaces the cloud index). On another device with the same credentials, the same vault name and no local cache, the plugin restores from that index.

Moss does not re-embed documents server-side during `pushIndex`; embeddings are computed on your machine.

## Telemetry

The `@moss-dev/moss` SDK may send pseudonymous usage telemetry, including a stable per-device identifier the SDK stores on disk. To opt out, set the environment variable before Obsidian starts — note that launching Obsidian from the Dock/Start menu does not inherit shell exports, so set it system-wide or launch from a terminal:

```bash
export MOSS_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1
```

## Your choices

- Keep cloud sync off (default) for a fully local index.
- Delete the local index: remove `.obsidian/plugins/moss-search/cache/`.
- Delete a synced index: remove `obsidian-<hash>` from your Moss project dashboard.
- Remove credentials: clear them in the plugin settings (this rewrites `data.json`).
