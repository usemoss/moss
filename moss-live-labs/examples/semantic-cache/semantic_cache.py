"""Semantic cache for LLM responses, built on Moss.

A normal cache keys on the exact text of a request, so two ways of asking the
same thing ("what are your hours?" / "when do you open?") miss and you pay the
model twice. A *semantic* cache keys on meaning: embed the question, look up the
nearest one you've already answered, and if it's close enough, return the stored
answer without calling the model.

The core is the SemanticCache class below (the `ask` method is the whole idea).
The one knob that matters is the similarity threshold.
