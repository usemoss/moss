"""Cross-agent handoff, built on Moss.

When a conversation moves between agents (chat -> voice), channels, or devices,
the context usually resets and the customer has to repeat themselves. With Moss,
every agent shares one *named session*. The first agent writes down what happened
and pushes it to the cloud; the next agent opens the same session by name, resumes
it (no re-embedding), and can immediately query context it never directly received.

This example simulates two independent agents in one process: agent A handles the
chat and hands off, then agent B (a fresh client, as if it were a different
service on voice) picks the session up and answers from the shared context.
