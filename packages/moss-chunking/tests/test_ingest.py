"""`refresh_source` tests.

Upsert alone cannot reconcile: a document that cuts into fewer chunks than it
used to leaves the old tail behind, still searchable, holding text that is no
longer in the document. These tests are about that tail — that it is found, that
it is deleted before the new chunks land, and that a document which did not
shrink pays one lookup for the privilege and nothing more.

The client is a fake. Everything under test is which calls get made and in what
order, which is exactly what a fake can answer and a live index cannot cheaply.
