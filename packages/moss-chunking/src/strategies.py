"""Built-in splitters. One class per strategy, all yielding `Chunk`.

Every splitter here reports `char` locators, because they all cut plain text and
character offsets are what plain text has. A splitter over paginated or line-
oriented content reports `page` or `line` instead — the contract does not care,
so long as the unit is declared.

The shared invariant, which the tests enforce: for a chunk produced from `text`,
`text[chunk.locator_start:chunk.locator_end] == chunk.text`. Offsets point into
the original string, never into a normalized or stripped copy of it.
