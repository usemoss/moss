    """Replace everything `index_name` holds for `source` with `documents`.

    Stable IDs make re-chunking an unchanged document a no-op and a rewritten one
    an overwrite — but only for the chunks that still exist. `add_docs` upserts,
    it does not reconcile: if `notes.md` used to cut into 21 chunks and now cuts
    into 6, `#chunk-0006` through `#chunk-0020` stay in the index, still
    searchable, holding text that is no longer in the document. Nothing errors,
    and the stale hits look exactly like real ones.

    So the tail is deleted before the new chunks go in. What makes finding it
    cheap is the contract itself: `chunk_document` guarantees indices run
    `0, 1, 2, …`, so anything left over sits in a contiguous run above the new
    chunk count, and looking up one window of candidate IDs past the end is
    enough to find it or prove it is not there.

    That contiguity is the one assumption here, so it is also maintained here:
    deletions run highest ID first and each one is waited on, which keeps what
    survives a failure an unbroken run that the next refresh will find. A source
    whose IDs were punched full of holes by something other than this package is
    outside the guarantee — reconciling that would mean scanning the whole
    `MAX_CHUNK_INDEX` space on every refresh, tens of round trips per document,
    to defend against a writer that is not honouring the contract anyway.

    Raises whatever `wait_for_job` raises if a deletion fails, rather than
    returning a result that implies a replacement which did not happen. Returns
    the add's `MutationResult`, which the caller can wait on in turn — or `None`
    when there was nothing to add.

    `documents` must be `source`'s entire cut, in order — `chunk_document`'s
    output for that source and nothing else. A mismatched ID raises before
    anything is deleted, since the whole reconciliation is arithmetic on
    `len(documents)` and the wrong list would delete live chunks.

    Passing no documents deletes every chunk for `source`, which is how a deleted
    file is removed from the index.

    `upsert` is set explicitly rather than left to the server's default, since
    replacing a chunk in place is the entire premise of the ID contract.
