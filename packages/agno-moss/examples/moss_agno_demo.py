"""
Moss: High-Performance Semantic Search
=======================================
Moss manages embeddings internally and serves queries from an in-memory
runtime, delivering sub-10ms latency with no external embedder required.

Setup:
    pip install moss

Environment variables:
    MOSS_PROJECT_ID   - Your Moss project ID
    MOSS_PROJECT_KEY  - Your Moss project key

Or pass project_id / project_key directly to MossVectorDb.
