"""
Mortgage Lending Voice Agent (multi-agent, with handoff)
========================================================

Two agents share one LiveKit session:

  1. MortgageRetrievalAgent
     - Answers retrieval-heavy mortgage questions (down payment, credit score,
       loan types, DTI, PMI, closing costs, documents needed, ...).
     - Grounded in a Moss index that lives in-process for sub-10ms search.
     - Hands off to PaymentFlowAgent when the customer is ready to pay.

  2. PaymentFlowAgent
     - Walks the customer through a structured payment flow (confirm loan,
       collect amount, choose method, confirm).
     - Reads/writes `MortgageSessionData` (shared via session.userdata) so
       facts the retrieval agent already gathered (loan number, last 4 of
       SSN, etc.) are not asked again.

The handoff is a single line: a function_tool returns the next Agent.
LiveKit preserves chat history so the conversation feels continuous.

                Phase 1 of the call is information gathering. Customers will ask
                detailed mortgage questions: down payment requirements, credit
                score thresholds, loan types (conventional, FHA, VA, jumbo),
                debt-to-income ratios, PMI rules, closing costs, required

                - ALWAYS call `search_mortgage_kb` before answering a factual
                  question. Never invent figures.
                - Keep answers short and conversational. This is voice — no
                  bullet points, no markdown.
                - When the customer signals they want to make a payment
                  ("I'd like to pay", "make my payment", "schedule a payment",
                  "pay my bill"), call `transfer_to_payment_flow`. Do not try

                Steps, in order:

                     `read_session_state`), confirm it back to the customer
                     instead of re-asking.
