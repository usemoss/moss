"""
Ecommerce Support Voice Agent
=============================

Showcase for the ``moss-agent`` SDK's process-wide ``MossAgent`` + per-room
``attach(ctx)`` pattern.

How it's wired:

  prewarm() (runs ONCE per worker process)
    |
    +-- MossAgent(project_id, project_key)
    +-- agent.load_indexes(["ecommerce_products",
                            "ecommerce_faq",
                            "ecommerce_policies"])
    +-- proc.userdata["moss_agent"] = agent

  handle_visit(ctx) (runs PER LiveKit room)
    |
    +-- await ctx.connect()
    +-- call = agent.attach(ctx)         <-- one line, scoped to this room
    +-- AgentSession(...).start(...)
    +-- Tool calls route every query through `call.query_multi_index(...)`
        so per-call telemetry (call_id, durationMs) attaches automatically.

Why this matters:

  The indexes are loaded once at boot. Every concurrent room queries the
  same warm in-process cache. There is no per-call cold start, no
  duplicated state, and search latency stays in the sub-10ms band even
  with hundreds of simultaneous calls.

  ``attach(ctx)`` is idempotent on ``ctx.room.name`` and registers a
  shutdown callback so the call scope closes automatically when the room
  tears down - no manual lifecycle code in your handler.

Run::

    # 1. Build the indexes once
    uv run python create_indexes.py

    # 2A. Talk in your terminal (no LiveKit server needed)
    uv run python agent.py console

    # 2B. Or register as a worker and dispatch from a browser
    uv run python agent.py dev

                    the search to the product catalog.
                  - Keep answers short and conversational. This is voice -
                    no bullet points, no markdown, no SKUs read aloud unless
                    the customer asks for one.
                  - If the search returns nothing useful, say you'll have a
